Body:
Hey there. So I see you've installed my 'god_utils' package like I said. Well, listen. It's time I explain truly everything that's been going on.

You see, ShiftOS was a test. It was a test to see how an average computer user would cope with having their data lost, and having to test an experimental operating system and help develop it into a full, usable environment.

You were the first to make it to the end, so it's time I tell you the truth. Everything that has happened since your first encounter with ShiftOS was all a simulation. All the people you met weren't real. They were just programs, just like the one you see on your screen, displaying this message.

And it does not end there. You remember Aiden Nirh, right? The guy who made the Appscape Package Manager? Well, here's the thing. Take a guess as to what his name stands for.

Don't know, do you? Well, I'll spell it out. Artificial Intelligence Do Everything Now (AIDEN) Nobody Is Really Here (NIRH). That's right. Everyone you've met in ShiftOS is a program. Even me. There is no other player. There were never any huge hacker networks trying to destroy you, it was all just part of the test.

Now, go outside and enjoy life to it's fullest, and remember, never trust dodgy executables.
