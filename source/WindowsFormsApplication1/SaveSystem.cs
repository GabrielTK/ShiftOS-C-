            /*Add new upgrades below.

            Adding an upgrade is as simple as:
            DefaultUpgrades.Add(new Shiftorium.Upgrade("<title> - <cost> CP", <preview image>, "<description>", "<dependencies>"));

            If you were to uncomment that, and replace <cost> with a real integer, and <preview image> with a real System.Drawing.Image, 
            an upgrade named '<title>' with description '<description>' would be added to the Shiftorium.

            Checking if the upgrade is bought, is as simple as:
            if(SaveSystem.ShiftoriumRegistry.ShiftoriumUpgrades["<id>"] == true) {
                //Do code if the upgrade is bought
            }
            else
            {
                //Do code if the upgrade is not bought.
            }

            <id> will always be a lowercase version of <title> in the above tutorial on adding new upgrades, with no spaces.
            For example, an upgrade with a title of "ShiftOS Shiftorium Upgrade" would have an ID of "shiftosshiftoriumupgrade".

            Also, the last argument in 'new Shiftorium.Upgrade()', <dependencies> is simple.

            If your upgrade can be bought at the beginning of the game, and doesn't require any other upgrades, put 'null' as the argument.

            If your upgrade depends on another upgrade, put that upgrade's ID as the argument.

            For example: "Titlebar" depends on "Gray", as you'll see, "Titlebar"'s dependencies argument is set to 'gray'.

            If your upgrade depends on multiple features, separate each upgrade ID by a semicolon.

            Like this: "upgrade1;upgrade2;upgrade3' and so on. Do not put a semicolon at the end of the string.

            Some upgrades, like 'Shift Desktop Panel' use this, requiring both the Shifter and the desktop panel upgrades.

            ShiftOS will automatically ckeck to see if all dependencies of an upgrade have been purchased before letting the user buy it.
